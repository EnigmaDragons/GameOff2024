Retro Notes:

1. What went well?
- Josh - Everything. Good communication. Integration was seamless.
- Ben - The dialogue came in nicely, very seamless.
- Ben - Josh's voice acting was fantastic. Very high quality!
- Ben - The initial game loop came together quickly.
- Carrie - Improved a lot at clothing
- Silas - Really good artistic bits from the team
- Silas - Using NeoFPS got us launched very quickly with the FPS movement
- Silas - Using DunGen for procedural generation was very powerful and fun
- Josh - The procedural generation is excellent!
- SizzlinKola - Voice acting was great. Really carried the scenes with black screens. 
- SizzlinKola - Parkour mechanics was pretty fun. 

2. What didn't go well?
- Josh - Everything went well!
- Ben - Some unexpected behavior/challenges with the Unity Scenes transitions and sound management
- Ben - There was a middle project lull, where the story and environment weren't moving forward as much
- Ben - Had too much stuff to do near the end, and couldn't get it all quite in
- Ben - The built copy (especially for Mac) had some last-minute hiccups
- Carrie - Shaders for the characters weren't great. If I were more familiar with Unity I'd make them look better. Ultimately the more stylized look fit the environment though
- Carrie - Work came up a lot during the jam
- Silas - Middle project lull
- Silas - Having the jam include holidays was challenging (especially having it near the end)
- Silas - Wanted the level designs to be more evolved, but ran into time constraints especially due to environment art progress
- Silas - The Spy AI was very hard to implement well
- SizzlinKola - Not enough time/crunch at the end to get a first version of the full narrative. Not enough time to iterate/polish it. 

3. What lessons can we take moving forward?
- Ben - We should have built and tested builds earlier
- Ben - Was the narrative scope too big?
- Ben - AI challenge should not be underestimated
- Josh - Really digging the spirit of the jam
- Josh - Some voice actors want the story locked in a little more before they are brought in
- Silas - Narrative is expensive. It requires a bit investment
- Silas - Environment art and level design go hand in hand. They are deeply linked.
- Silas - Evolve level design skill to be able to greybox faster and with more fidelity
- Carrie - Plan better. Don't overcommit.
- Carrie - Building a broader technical stack will increase employability
- SizzlinKola - Reduce scope of narrative or commit to it much earlier in the jam so that everyone understands the full scope. 

4. What was your personal favorite part of the jam?
- Silas - When I first saw real spy chasing working, the spy could climb, and the spy could slide. So cool!
- Ben - Really loved the Intro Audio cutscene coming together, processing the voice.
- Ben - Really happy with the main menu music
- Carrie - Seeing the first-person movement for the first time
- Josh - Bringing Maria on board (got to be a casting director for a bit)
- SizzlinKola - Playing through the game the first time with all the voice acting and animations, seeing it all come together. 

5. What is your favorite thing in the game?
- Josh - The characters are T-Posing, and when you get close enough to them they put their arms down and start to move.
- Josh - The parkour was SMOOTH
- Ben - Enjoyed the parkour... Reminds me of Apex Legends
- Ben - Loves when the spy bulldozes through the props
- Silas - Amazing voice acting really brough the story life
- Carrie - The soundtrack!
- SizzlinKola - The voice acting! Second is the sliding. I love sliding.

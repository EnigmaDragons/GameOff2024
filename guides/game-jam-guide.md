# Game Jam Guide

This jam is a bit different than most. We're not just making a game, we're also going to be marketing it and getting it ready for a commercial release.

----

### Your Personal Goals

1. Have fun!
2. Challenge yourself and expand your skills
3. Create something cool that you can showcase for years
4. Don't burn yourself out

If you accomplish this, then you succeeded at the jam, regardless of how people rate the actual game. 

----

### Our Team Goals

1. Create something fun to play
2. Create a complete (though small) experience
3. Ship a game with a good amount of polish

----

### How Do We Achieve That?

1. Keep a small scope!
2. Try to fit as many creation iterations as possible (milestones)
3. Take breaks, exercise, eat, get sunshine, get solid sleep
4. Save time at the end for polish
